    <p>If you downloaded the App from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge that:</p>

    <h2>15. Dispute Resolution for US/Canada Residents</h2>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>15.1 BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
        <p>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE APP WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION,
            RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>

        <h3>15.2 CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
        <p>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT
            IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
            in arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>
